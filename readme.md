### Purpose

---

This repository contains programs which I wrote to follow along with, and  
test the examples in the book:

- _C Programming, A Modern Approach, 2nd ed._ by K. N. King

I highly recommend this book for learning C.  
Further details on the book can be found here: http://knking.com/books/c2/
